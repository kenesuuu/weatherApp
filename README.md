User Weather API - https://openweathermap.org/api 

Develop a React JS Weather Application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data for a specified city. The Weather app will present information such as temperature, weather conditions, humidity levels, and wind speed based on the chosen city. To access precise weather data, simply input the city's name into the app, which relies on a free API service.
